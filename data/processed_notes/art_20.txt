High training accuracy indicates that a model fits the training data well, but it does not guarantee good performance on unseen data. A model that performs well only on training data may fail when deployed in real-world scenarios.

Generalisation refers to a model’s ability to apply learned patterns to new, unseen examples. This depends on factors such as data quality, model complexity, and regularisation techniques.

Focusing on generalisation rather than training accuracy leads to more reliable and robust machine learning systems.
