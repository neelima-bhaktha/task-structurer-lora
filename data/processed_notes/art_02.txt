Training a language model from scratch requires large datasets, extensive compute resources, and long training times. For most real-world applications, this approach is unnecessary and impractical.

Fine-tuning allows developers to start from a pre-trained model and adapt it to a specific task or domain. This significantly reduces cost while preserving the model’s general language understanding.

As a result, fine-tuning has become the standard approach for deploying language models in production, especially when the task scope is narrow and well-defined.
