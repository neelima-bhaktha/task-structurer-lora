Regularisation techniques are used to prevent overfitting by discouraging overly complex models. They introduce additional constraints or penalties during training.

Common regularisation methods include L1 and L2 regularisation, which penalise large parameter values. These methods encourage simpler models that generalise better.

Regularisation improves robustness without significantly reducing performance on training data.
