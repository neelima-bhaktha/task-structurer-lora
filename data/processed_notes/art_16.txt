An epoch represents one complete pass through the training dataset. Batches divide the dataset into smaller subsets for efficient processing.

An iteration refers to a single update of model parameters using one batch. The number of iterations per epoch depends on the batch size.

Understanding these terms is important for controlling training duration and performance.
