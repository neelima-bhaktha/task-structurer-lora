A loss function defines how well a machine learning model’s predictions align with the true values. It provides the signal that guides learning during optimisation.

Different tasks require different loss functions. For example, mean squared error is commonly used for regression problems, while cross-entropy loss is preferred for classification tasks.

Choosing an appropriate loss function is critical, as it directly influences training dynamics and final model behaviour.
