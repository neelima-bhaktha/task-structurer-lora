A validation set is used to tune hyperparameters and make model design decisions without touching the test data. It acts as an intermediate checkpoint during development.

Using test data for tuning can lead to biased evaluation results. A separate validation set helps maintain the integrity of the final performance measurement.

This separation ensures that the test set reflects true generalisation ability.
