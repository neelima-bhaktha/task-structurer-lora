Activation functions introduce non-linearity into neural networks, allowing them to model complex relationships. Without activation functions, neural networks would behave like linear models regardless of depth.

Popular activation functions include ReLU, sigmoid, and tanh. Each has distinct properties that affect gradient flow and training stability.

The choice of activation function can significantly impact convergence speed and overall model performance.
