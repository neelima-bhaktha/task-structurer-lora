Evaluation metrics define how model performance is measured. Different tasks require different metrics to capture what “good performance” means.

Accuracy alone can be misleading, especially with imbalanced datasets. Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score provide deeper insight.

Choosing the right metric ensures that model optimisation aligns with real-world goals.
