Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple to capture underlying patterns in the data. Such models perform poorly on both training and test datasets.

High bias is a common cause of underfitting. Increasing model complexity or improving feature representation can help address it.

Identifying underfitting early prevents wasted effort on ineffective models.
