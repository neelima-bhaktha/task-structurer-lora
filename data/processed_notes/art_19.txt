A train-test split separates data used for learning from data used for evaluation. This helps estimate how well a model will perform on unseen data.

Training and testing on the same data leads to misleading performance results. The split enforces a realistic evaluation setup.

Proper data splitting is a foundational practice in machine learning experiments.
