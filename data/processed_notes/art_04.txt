General-purpose AI systems aim to handle a wide range of tasks, but this flexibility can reduce reliability in specific use cases. Broad objectives often introduce ambiguity and unpredictable behaviour.

Narrow AI systems are designed for a single task or domain, allowing tighter constraints and clearer evaluation criteria. This leads to more consistent and controllable outputs.

For production systems, narrow AI often provides better reliability and easier maintenance than general-purpose solutions.
